Readme for Term_Project_Simulation

Introduction

This is a project to pass the computer science exam of the University of Applied Sciences "TH-Bingen", where we have to simulate some further programming tasks using Kotlin and IntelliJ IDEA, Git and GitHub, as well as Maven and Travis. The Project started on July 30th, 20017 and has to be finished on August 13th, 2017. The lecturer of the computer science module and the creator of this by now legendary term project is Nicolai Parlog.

The Members of this project are (real name / GitHub user name):

Steffen Konrad / SteffenKonrad
Florian Kirch / flowsen39
Hendrik Hoffmann / H-Hoffmann
As this is an public project on GitHub, we decide to add a license as well as a code of conduct, so that everyone knows the rules and how to behave. We want everyone participating in this project to treat everyone else respectful and correctly.

The Project is divided into four parts with multiple tasks, which we have to go through and solve all the tasks. Below we will list the parts and a short description of each.

Part 1: Project Infrastucture The first part of this project is all about basic infrastructure, like choosing a language for comments and conversation on GitHub and for the Readme. We choosed German for the conversation and the comments and English for the Readme, which is also a task of this infrastructure part. We also have to pick a code of conduct and a license, that we wanÂ´t to add to our project and to the readme. The next tasks now includes some programming, by using Kotlin and IntelliJ to create a project that contains a simple "HelloWorld.kt" class with a main method printing "Hello, World." It should successfully buil a JAR (Java ARchive), so that Maven and Travis can deal with it. By extending "pom.xml" and a writing a small HelloWorldTest, we finish the first part of the project and can release version 1.0.
